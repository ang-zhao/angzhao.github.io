    "text": "Angela is a PhD student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Her research interests are mainly in methods of analyzing time-series data, including stochastic modeling, neural networks, and functional data analysis. Domain-specific interests include wearable device, imaging, and financial data.\nMore recently, she was awarded an honorable mention for the Gertrude M. Cox Scholarship by the American Statistics Association at JSM 2024. She presented her work Inference for the Extended Functional Cox Model: A UK Biobank Case Study at the ENAR 2025 conference and will present Data-Driven Risk Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Device-Measured Physical Activity and Robust Variable Selection in an invited session at JSM 2025. Currently, she serves on the Doctoral Student Council as the Biostatistics Representative.\nHer hobbies include bouldering, investing, stand-up comedy, and playing classical music (fun fact: she previously taught piano for 4 years)."

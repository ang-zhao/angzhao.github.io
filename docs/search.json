She has a Joint BS in Computer Science and Biology with a Minor in Maths from McGill University (2022).\nHer research interests are mainly in methods of analyzing time-series data, including stochastic modeling, neural networks, and functional data analysis. Domain-specific application interests include wearable device, imaging, and financial data.\nHobbies include bouldering, investing, stand-up comedy, and playing classical music (fun fact: she previously taught piano for 4 years)."

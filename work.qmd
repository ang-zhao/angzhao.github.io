## Research Positions

-   **Currently working on a tool to forecast call volume in collaboration with the Owings Mills Volunteer Firehouse to address staffing demands.**

<!-- -->

-   **Emerald Advisors, LLC \|** *Life Sciences Research Analyst Intern* \| May 2024 - Aug. 2024

    -   Assisted senior analysts in covering 20+ biotech/therapeutics companies at a long-only firm managing ∼\$5B of AUM.

    -   Evaluated scientific literature, clinical trial data, and business filings as part of the due diligence process for new ideas.

    -   Contributed to the BUY decision on a stock that went up 50+% and made a positive 8bps impact to the portfolio.

    -   Conducted due diligence for an IPO, including constructing comps tables and reviewing SEC-1 filings.

-   **Johns Hopkins University, Wearable and Implantable Technology Group** \| *Research Associate for Dr. Ciprian Crainiceanu* \| Sep. 2022 - Present

    -   Helped develop inference procedures for functional cox models that consider the inherent correlation of timeseries data.

    -   Demonstrated that wearable device metrics improve the performance of traditional survival models by up to 10%.

    -   Produced robust R pipelines for analyzing high-dimensional data on a cluster computer (N = 500, 000, p \> 1000).

    -   This work resulted in 1 peer-reviewed paper Springer Journal of Neurology and 3 papers under revision.

-   **Johns Hopkins University, Department of Biostatistics** \| *Research Assistant for Dr. Brian Caffo* \| Jul. 2023 - May 2024

    -   Comprehensively compared stochastic timeseries models to capture the complex dynamics of real/simulated fMRI data.
    -   Leveraged the Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Keras libraries in Python to tune and test RNNs, transformers, and AR models.
    -   Proposed that the potency of transformers suggest a form of neural context that challenges standard fMRI assumptions.
    -   This work resulted in 1 peer-reviewed review article in Annual Reviews of Statistics and 1 paper under revision.

-   **McGill University, Quantitative Life Sciences** \| *Research Assistant for Dr. Jackie Vogel* \| Jan. 2020 - Aug. 2022

    -   Developed shape analysis pipelines in Java and Python to identify droplet-like behaviours in proteins from video data.

    -   Leveraged ML for artifact removal and signal processing; weighted-mean/Gaussian approaches for subpixel positioning.

    -   Contributed to single-cell analysis software for super-resolution image data that lead to 8+ talks, posters, and abstracts.

Angela Zhao is a PhD student in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at Johns Hopkins University. Her research interests are mainly in methods of analyzing time-series data, including stochastic modeling, neural networks, and functional data analysis. Domain-specific interests include wearable device, imaging, and financial data.

More recently, she was awarded an honorable mention for the [Gertrude M. Cox Scholarship](https://ang-zhao.github.io/angzhao.github.io/education.html#awards) by the [American Statistics Association](https://www.amstat.org/) at [JSM 2024](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/). She presented her work [Inference for the Extended Functional Cox Model: A UK Biobank Case Study](publications.qmd) at the [ENAR 2025](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2025/) conference and will present [Data-Driven Risk Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Device-Measured Physical Activity and Robust Variable Selection](publications.qmd) in an invited session at [JSM 2025](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2025/). Currently, she serves on the [Doctoral Student Council](https://ang-zhao.github.io/angzhao.github.io/work.html#leadership-positions) as the Biostatistics Representative.

Her hobbies include bouldering, investing, stand-up comedy, and playing classical music (fun fact: she previously taught piano for 4 years).
